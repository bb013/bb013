## 👋 Hi, I’m @bb013
- I'm a CNC and manual machinist who spends most of the time using Gibbscam to generate G-Code for lathes, mill-turn lathes, and 3 and 4-axis mills, then setting those machines up and operating them. I also spin cast babbit bearings, ballance impellers and impeller shaft assemblies, and can surface or cylindrical grind as needed.
### 👀 I’m interested in ...
- CAD
- CAM
- Lean manufacturing
- Project management and workflow
### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Solidworks
- Git
- Github
- Macros for use in Gibbscam
### 💞️ I’d like to work on and or to collaborate on ...
- Developing an open source project management and time tracking program geared towards manufacturing
